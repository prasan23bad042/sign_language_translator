# ✋ Sign Language Translator

A simple **Sign Language Translator** project that demonstrates how trained model weights can be used to recognize hand signs and produce meaningful output.  
This project focuses on loading pre-trained parameters and generating predictions based on input data.

## 📌 Project Overview

Sign language is an essential communication medium for the hearing-impaired community.  
This project aims to **translate sign language gestures into understandable output** using pre-trained model weights stored as NumPy arrays.

The model parameters are stored in `.npy` files and are loaded during execution to perform inference.

## 🧠 Model Files

The following NumPy files represent the trained model parameters:

- `w1.npy` – Weight matrix (Layer 1)
- `b1.npy` – Bias vector (Layer 1)
- `b2.npy` – Bias vector (Layer 2)
- `b3.npy` – Bias vector (Layer 3)
- `b4.npy` – Bias vector (Layer 4)

These files are required for the model to work correctly.
